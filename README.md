### :books: ITT1 Discover IoT - Project Nerf Alpha
The project is for nerf gun enthusiastic people or for kids who likes to play around with nerf and BB guns. The user would however will be able to to have statistics like one is able to in modern computer games. Also a display counter will show the user how many bullets/darts are left in the magazine. Another thing that will be shown is how many shots has been fired in total A button to press in case of a misfire. This can be used to calculate "mean time between failures".

### :books: ITT2 Datacenter IoT Project
Datacenter Project is about monitoring enviormental variables in a datacenter. This project will innovate how the Datacenter Industry monitors the heat and humidity that comes off of data racks. Our solution will be more affordable than other leading solutions and more reliable.  This project was done with the OME education from Fredericia maskinmesterskole

### :books: ITT3 Solar Panel Project
This project is working towards a solution for solar panels. They normally don't follow the sun, instead sitting in a single direction and soaking up solar radiation. We want to optimize that process so we're getting 100% of the sun 100% of the time. To that end we're working on technology to figure out where the sun is with a shadowbox and calculating where we will get the most light with and helps safeguard the solar panel controls, not allowing it to damage itself.

## :file_folder: Final Project
### :books: Air Quality Monitoring System
AQMS project aims to provide a low-cost air quality monitoring IoT device that analyses airborne pollution levels as well as temperature and humidity. Thereby, providing users with the ability to track the changes in air quality for their homes and facilities.

## :file_folder: Industrial Application
### :books: Universal Robots User Interface
This is UR Project revolves around interfaceing a universal robot through the primary/secondary interface, using TCP/IP.
The project is is about recieving message from the U.R robot, the received message then have to be decripted.
The movement of the U.R also needs to be controlled by a GUI.
